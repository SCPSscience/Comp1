This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake. When two blocks of rock or two plates are rubbing against each other, they stick a little. They don't just slide smoothly; the rocks catch on each other. The rocks are still pushing against each other, but not moving. After a while, the rocks break because of all the pressure that's built up. When the rocks break, the earthquake occurs. During the earthquake and afterward, the plates or blocks of rock start moving, and they continue to move until they get stuck again. The spot underground where the rock breaks is called the focus of the earthquake. The place right above the focus (on top of the ground) is called the epicenter of the earthquake.\n","\n","\n","Most earthquakes occur along the edge of the oceanic and continental plates. The earth's crust (the outer layer of the planet) is made up of several pieces, called plates. The plates under the oceans are called oceanic plates and the rest are continental plates. The plates are moved around by the motion of a deeper part of the earth (the mantle) that lies underneath the crust. These plates are always bumping into each other, pulling away from each other, or past each other. The plates usually move at about the same speed that your fingernails grow. Earthquakes usually occur where two plates are running into each other or sliding past each other.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","<center><img src=\"https://www.gns.cri.nz/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/images/tectonic-plates-map-gif/15909-1-eng-GB/tectonic-plates-map-gif_imagelarge.gif\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n","  </br>\n"," In this coding activity you will be using data that is pulled real-time from the USGS (The United States Geological Survey) website.  That means that as new earthquakes occur they are added to the list (almost in realtime).  This is something that was unheard of in scientific research until the last decade or so.
